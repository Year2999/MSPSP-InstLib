# MSPSP Instance Library

Library of instances of the Multi-Skill Project Scheduling Problem (MSPSP).

## Format

Each instance is provided as an individual DataZinc file (dzn) which are naturally compability with the modelling language MiniZinc. New instances can be created in any desired format by editting the instance generator as you see fit (refer to Python scripts in the `gen-inst\` directory).

We note that in each data file the number of activities (denoted *n*) does not include the dummy start and end activities. So n=20 corresponds to a total of 22 activities.

For a detailed description of the format within any one DataZinc file we refer you to `.\format-description.pdf`.

## Instances

All instances can be found in the `instances\` directory. The instances are divided into two primary sets, which are further divided into a total of five subsets.

### Set 1'

This data set was generated using the instance generator. For the full specification of the two subsets generated we refer you to Almeida *et al.* 2015.

* Set 1'a: (**100% solved**) 216 instances with 22 activities, 4 skills and 10-30 resources.
* Set 1'b: (**12.5% solved**) 216 instances with 42 activities, 4 skills and 20-60 resources.

Note, because we were unable to get in contact with the original creators of the instance generator and access their data, we instead generated our own set of instances with identical input parameters as their benchmark data. If the original data set is denoted by Set 1, we denote our equivalent data set by Set 1'.

### Set 2

This data set is a selection of the available benchmark instances used by the literature. For the full specification of the three subsets we refer you to Montoya *et al.* 2014.

* Set 2a: (**73.64% solved**) 110 instances with 20-51 activities, 2-8 skills and 5-14 resources.
* Set 2b: (**81.82% solved**) 77 instances with 32-62 activities, 9-15 skills and 5-19 resources.
* Set 2c: (**100% solved**) 91 instances with 22-32 activities, 3-12 skills and 4-15 resources.

### Set 3

The remaining benchmark instances that were made available to us from the literature which have not yet been tested.

These instances are organised in the same way as set 2 as they have been adapted from the same instances of the RCPSP, but their parameters fall outside the ranges considered by Montoya *et al.*. As such, each subset of set 3 contains instances with a very small or very large number of activities/skills/resources. Even though these instances have as yet been untested, we anticipate that the very small instances can be trivially solved.

* Set 3a: (**untested**) 73 instances with 7-51 activities, 2-8 skills and 1-22 resource(s).
* Set 3b: (**untested**) 112 instances with 32-122 activities, 9-15 skills and 5-34 resources.
* Set 3c: (**untested**) 109 instances with 22-92 activities, 3-15 skills and 4-15 resources.

The instances from set 3b and 3c with 92 and 122 activities are currently the most difficult in this library.

## Instance Generator

The instance generator was developed by Young *et al.* 2017 and it was originally created by Almeida *et al.* 2015.
