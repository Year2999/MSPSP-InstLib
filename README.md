# MSPSP Instance Library

Library of instances of the Multi-Skill Project Scheduling Problem (MSPSP).

The MSPSP is a relatively new variant on the classical Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem
(RCPSP) with the additional consideration of multi-skilled resources.
This consideration introduces a set of assignment decisions, further to the usual
scheduling decisions, which result in a non-trivial layer of complexity.

This library provides all instances used in the computational experiments of a 
2017 research paper as well as the author's full-results.
Some additional untested instances (set 3) are also included in this library.

## Data Format

Each instance is provided as an individual DataZinc file (dzn) which are 
naturally compability with the modelling language MiniZinc. 
New instances can be created in any desired format by editting the 
instance generator as you see fit (refer to Python scripts in the `gen-inst/` directory).

For a detailed description of the format within any one DataZinc 
file we refer you to `format-description.pdf`.

## Instances

All instances can be found in the `instances/` directory. 
The instances are divided into three primary sets, 
which are further divided into a total of eight subsets.
Only set 1 and set 2 have been tested.

### [Set 1'](./instances/set-1/)'

This data set was generated using the instance generator. 
A partial specification of the two subsets generated is given in the directory
`instances/set-1/`.
We refer you to Almeida *et al.* 2015 for a detailed specification where an equivalent set of data
was originally created.

* Set 1'a: (**100% solved**) 216 instances with 22 activities, 4 skills and 10-30 resources.
* Set 1'b: (**12.5% solved**) 216 instances with 42 activities, 4 skills and 20-60 resources.

### [Set 2](./instances/set-2/)

This data set is a selection of the available benchmark instances used by the literature. 
For the full specification of the three subsets, including their origin, we refer you to Montoya *et al.* 2014.
Set 2 can be considered as a selection of small and medium sized instances of the MSPSP.

* Set 2a: (**73.64% solved**) 110 instances with 20-51 activities, 2-8 skills and 5-14 resources.
* Set 2b: (**81.82% solved**) 77 instances with 32-62 activities, 9-15 skills and 5-19 resources.
* Set 2c: (**100% solved**) 91 instances with 22-32 activities, 3-12 skills and 4-15 resources.

### [Set 3](./instances/set-3/)

This set contains the remaining benchmark instances that were made available to us from the 
literature.

These instances are organised in the same way as set 2 as they have been 
adapted from the same instances of the RCPSP.
However, their parameter values fall outside the ranges considered by Montoya *et al.*
in set 2.
As such, each subset of set 3 contains instances with a very small or 
very large number of activities/skills/resources. 
Even though these instances have as yet been untested, 
we anticipate that the very small instances can be trivially solved.

* Set 3a: (**untested**) 73 instances with 7-51 activities, 2-8 skills and 1-22 resource(s).
* Set 3b: (**untested**) 112 instances with 32-122 activities, 9-15 skills and 5-34 resources.
* Set 3c: (**untested**) 109 instances with 22-92 activities, 3-15 skills and 4-15 resources.

<!-- The instances from set 3b and 3c with 92 and 122 activities are likely the most difficult in this library. -->

## Instance Generator

The instance generator was developed by Young *et al.* 2017 and it was originally created by Almeida *et al.* 2015.
