# Set 2

Benchmark instances from the literature originally selected from those available by Montoya *et al.* 2014.

* Set 2a: (**73.64% solved**) 110 instances with 20-51 activities, 2-8 skills and 5-14 resources.
* Set 2b: (**81.82% solved**) 77 instances with 32-62 activities, 9-15 skills and 5-19 resources.
* Set 2c: (**100% solved**) 91 instances with 22-32 activities, 3-12 skills and 4-15 resources.

Note, we were unable to get in contact with the authors who originally 
chose these subsets as benchmark instances.
However, from previous work with the authors (MiniZinc Challenge 2012),
we had access to all the data they used --- 
a total of 572 benchmark instances.
So we chose to run our experiments on
all instances from those available which satisfied the parameter ranges defined above.

Montoya *et al.* experimented with a total of 271 instances
while we found 278 instances which fell within their parameter ranges.
